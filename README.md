# New Yorker Caption Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot that takes the text of a @mention and adds it to a random [New Yorker cartoon](http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/random/).

Just for fun. Not affiliated with the actual New Yorker magazine in any way.

Based on the [Gomix Twitter Bot](https://gomix.com/#!/project/twitterbot) example.
